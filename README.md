# Coding & Cocktails 2018 CodeJam!


For Coding & Cocktails 2018 CodeJam!, our team built our own `Angular Single Page Application` using `Angular CLI` that we have learned from Coding & Cocktails' October session -- Introduction to Single Page Applications (SPAs). 

Our team of four created a single page app showcasing cocktail options for attendees to choose a drink.
